# We Work in Phx

Citizenry is a simple, friendly wiki-like web application for communities to keep track of the people, companies, groups, and projects that make them great.

The [mchung/weworkinphx-citizenry](http://github.com/mchung/weworkinphx-citizenry) branch of Citizeny was built to power [We Work In Phx](http://www.weworkinphx.com), a guide to the awesome tech community of Phoenix, Arizona.
